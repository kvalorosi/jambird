This offering is all about cycling- everything is individually wrapped so you can easily throw it in a jersey pocket or pack.

All baked goods are made in a home kitchen and protected under the Colorado Cottage Act.  

Portable, packable, perfect pocket snacks. All vegetarian. Some sweet. Some savory.

After serving as a soigneiur on multiple occasions, I received incredible feedback from riders- Jambird is my answer to real food for real cyclists. Energy bars and liquid fuel are readily available but cafeâ€™s and coffee shops can be less common along ride routes. Cyclists crave real food, freshly made, with high quality ingredients. Jambird offers riders packable, home baked goods to take on a ride, near or far. Jambird offers customizable offerings with high quality ingredients. Every order is individually wrapped and ready to go for a ride. Throw a batch of banana bread in the freezer or share a batch of cookie bars with your cycling crew. 

I love to bake. I love to bike. Jambird marries the two together into a sharable offering that makes it as simple as pie to bring fresh baked goods on a bike ride.
